          Albert Einstein was a German-born scientist. He worked on theoretical
          physics. He developed the theory of relativity.<br />He received the
          Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for theoretical physics. He lived in
          the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.<br />He is
          widely considered one of the greatest scientists of all time. His
          contributions helped lay the foundations for all modern branches of
          physics, including quantum mechanics and relativity.<br />Many
          scientists only care about their work, but Einstein also spoke and
          wrote often about politics and world peace. Einstein's family was
          Jewish, but Einstein never practised this religion seriously.<br />He
          liked the ideas of the Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza and also
          thought that Buddhism was a good religion.
